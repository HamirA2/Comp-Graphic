# How do I approach designing software?
For the project, I learned how to implement and use functions to design a unique 3D scene. These functions include setting transformations for objects that adjusted the scaling, rotation, and positioning, while also using functions to properly set textures, lighting, colors, and materials to create a nature scene that resembles views from documentaries. Functions that adjusted movement also allowed my scene to be viewed dynamically using input from a keyboard or mouse. The design process I followed for the project was building up concepts each week, testing each concept on separate files before adding everything together once I understood how the conepts can be combined to create an effective scene. This design process can be used for future work to support creating small programs in iterations where I start off testing the programs to make sure I understand what I am doing and the features in the program are behaving as expected, before putting each program together to form a polished product.
